# Silo
Budgeting Tool &amp; Spending Tracker (Android App)

Silo is a free budgeting tool and spending tracker for Android. I was frustrated with the complexity of other free apps on the Play Store, so the core design principle of Silo is to make budgeting as fast and effective as possible. From opening the app, detailed expenses (such as recording the purchase of a Â£1.00 snack using cash on the current day) can be input and saved with as little as 4 taps. Functionality extends to managing money accounts, allocating/budgeting funds to a limitless list of user-defined categories, a historical recap of last months budget for comparison, the ability to leave notes with transactions (both expenses and incomes) and much more. Check it out on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.silofinance.silo).

This was an independent personal project that I undertook to keep busy after my undergraduate CERN internship was cancelled due to the outbreak of COVID-19. I started from scratch, scratch, self-teaching Java, Kotlin and general object-oriented programming, then UI/UX design, database management, marketing and more on the fly.
